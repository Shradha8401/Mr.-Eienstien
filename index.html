                <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, 
                    widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known 
                    for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development
                     of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars 
                     of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity 
                     theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its 
                     influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his 
                     services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric 
                     effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and 
                     originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>Albert Einstein’s hobbies were sailing, reading and playing the violin and piano. He also wrote travel journals that are now held in the Albert Einstein Archives in Jerusalem. Einstein owned several sailboats in his lifetime. He kept one in Caputh, Germany, that was seized along with his cottage in 1933 when the Nazis took power. When he lived in the United States, he owned a sailboat called Tinnef. Einstein enjoyed reading and is quoted as saying that “Traktat” by David Humes had a big influence on him. He enjoyed classics, such as Don Quijote by Cervantes Saavedra and books with a scientific bent, including “Energy and Matter” by Ludwig Büchners and Aaron Bernstein’s “Natural-Scientific Popular Books.” He also read books by the philosophers Spinoza and Schopenhauer.</p>

            <b>Albert Einstein Quotes - Science </b> "Imagination is more important than knowledge." - Albert Einstein "If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?" - Albert Einstein "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science." - Albert Einstein "People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." - Albert Einstein "The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once." - Albert Einstein "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius --- and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." - Albert Einstein "When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence: Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter." - Albert Einstein "For every one billion particles of antimatter there were one billion and one particles of matter. And when the mutual annihilation was complete, one billionth remained - and that's our present universe." - Albert Einstein "As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality." - Albert Einstein "I don't believe in mathematics." - Albert Einstein "Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it." - Albert Einstein "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible." - Albert Einstein "I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research." - Albert Einstein
